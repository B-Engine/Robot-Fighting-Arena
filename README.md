Robot Game

## Combat Overview

Mechs will have power cells that they use to operate parts. Some parts may cost more or less power than others. Some parts may make use of excess power cells during combat such as a shield emitter turning excess power into shields or a weapon that can be "overcharged" to do more damage.

Each part will have its own health and the chassis will have its own health. When a part has 0 health or no power it can no longer be used in combat (and will need repairs afterwards).

Armor parts will either add health or act as damage reduction. If damage reduction it could be balanced as to make small arms completely ineffective, just a thought.

It seems somewhat silly to lump cyber attacks in with general damage so they should be more active effects such as disabling power cells or certain augments.

Each active part will have a speed value to act as its cooldown, turn order will be based on these cooldowns. On a part's turn the pilot will determine the part's target until the end of the round. The round is over once all parts have gone (or maybe every cooldown, still haven't decided).

The real focus of the game should be on the management so combat should be streamlined and quick, but with juicy animations that keep it interesting.

We will need UI sections for friendly mechs/parts, enemy mechs/parts, selected parts, and maybe a cooldown timeline so players can plan ahead.

Specializations and well thought out strategy should outplay brute force and luck.
