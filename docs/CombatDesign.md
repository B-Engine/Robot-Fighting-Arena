# Combat Design

This document aims to design the combat mechanics and their various surrounding systems.

## Overview

The combat system itself will be mostly autonomous: players will build a team of mechs and their pilots, and pit them against other players and AI teams. Player agency comes from the ability to customize and improve their mechs and pilots, giving them an edge on the battlefield. There are several systems that influence the combat system:

- Mech components
  - Mech components are the physical pieces that provide the mech's functionality and structure. This can be anything from a nuclear-powered energy supply to a 30-foot flamethrower, and everything in-between.
- Mech software
  - Mech software is the digital counterpart to components. A mech with the latest targeting software can often lock onto its target faster than those running the later models, and be able to utilize the newest physical components.
- Pilot abilities
  - Pilot "abilities" are benefits that a pilot starts with: these are natural abilities that the pilot was born with. For example, perhaps the pilot has a mind for mechanical things and therefore performs better naturally to field repair.
- Pilot skills
  - Pilot "skills" are learned traits that a pilot has gained through experience. Someone who has been piloting mechs for 10 years will generally be more adept at moving their mech than a brand-new pilot.
